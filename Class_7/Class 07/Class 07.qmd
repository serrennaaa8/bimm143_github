Today we will explore some fundamental machine learning methods including clusterin & dimensionally reduction 

## K-means clustering
To see how this works let's first makeup some data to cluster where we know what the answer should be. We can use the `rnorm()` function to help here:

```{r}
#(n, mean=0, sd=1)
hist(rnorm(500, mean=5))
```

```{r}
x <- c(rnorm(30, mean = -3), rnorm(30, mean=3))
y <- rev(x)
```

```{r}
x <- cbind(x,y)
plot(x)
```

The function for K-means clustering in "base" R `kmeans()`

```{r}
k <-kmeans(x, centers = 2)
k
```

To get at the results of the returned list object we can use the dollar `$` syntax 

>Q. How many points are in each cluster?

```{r}
k$size
```

> Q. What 'component' of your result object details
  - cluster assignment/membership?
  - cluster center?
  
```{r}
k$centers
```

> Q. Make a clustering results figure of the data colored by cluster membership and show cluster centers. 

```{r}
plot(x, col= k$cluster, pch=16)
points(k$centers, col="blue", pch=15, cex=2)
```

K-means clustering is very popular as it is very fast and relatively straight forward: it takes numeric data as input and returns the cluster membership vector etc.

The "issue" is we tell `kmeans()` how many clusters we want!

> Q. Run kmeans again and cluster into 4 groups/clusters and plot the results like we did above? 

```{r}
k4 <- kmeans(x, centers = 4)
plot(x, col=k4$cluster)
points(k4$centers, pch=15)
```

Scree plot to pick k `centers` value

brute-force
```{r}
k1 <- kmeans(x, centers = 1) 
k2 <- kmeans(x, centers = 2) 
k3 <- kmeans(x, centers = 3) 
k4 <- kmeans(x, centers = 4) 
k5 <- kmeans(x, centers = 5) 
```

```{r}
z <- c(k1$tot.withinss,
       k2$tot.withinss,
       k3$tot.withinss,
       k4$tot.withinss,
       k5$tot.withinss)
```

```{r}
n <-NULL
for(i in 1:5){
  n <- c(n, kmeans(x, centers=i)$tot.withinss)
}

plot(n,typ="b")
```

## Hierarchical CLustering

The mean "base" R function for Hierarchical Clustering is called `hclust()`. Here we can't just input our data we need to first calculate a distance matrix (e.g. `dist()`) for our data and use this as input to `hclust()`

```{r}
d <- dist(x)
hc <- hclust(d)
hc
```

There is a plot method for hclust results lets try it

```{r}
plot(hc)
abline(h=8, col="red")
```

To get our cluster "membership" vector (i.e. our main clustering result) we can "cut" the tree at a given height or at a height that yields a given "k" groups. 

```{r}
cutree(hc, h=8)
```

```{r}
grps <- cutree(hc, k=2)
```

> Q. Plot the data with our hclust result coloring 

```{r}
plot(x, col=grps)
```

# Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

##PCA of UK food data

Import food data from an online CSV file

```{r}
url <- "https://tinyurl.com/UK-foods"
x <- read.csv(url)
head(x)
```

```{r}
x <- read.csv(url, row.names=1)
head(x)
```

```{r}
x <- read.csv(url, row.names = 1)
x
```

Some base figures 

```{r}
barplot(as.matrix(x), beside = T, col = rainbow(nrow(x)))
```

```{r}
barplot(as.matrix(x), beside=FALSE, col=rainbow(nrow(x)))
```

There is one plot that can be useful for small datasets:

```{r}
pairs(x, col=rainbow(10), pch=16)
```

> Main point: It can be difficult to spot major trends and pattersn even in relatively small multivariate datasets (here we only have 17 dimensions, typically we have 1000s). 

## PCA to the rescue

The main function is "base" R for PCA is called `prcomp()`

I will take the transpose of our daata so the "foods" are in the columns:

```{r}
pca <- prcomp(t(x))
summary(pca)
```

```{r}
cols <- c("orange", "red", "blue", "darkgreen")
plot(pca$x[,1], pca$x[,2], col=cols, pch=16)
```

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r}
ggplot(pca$x) +
  aes(PC1, PC2) +
  geom_point(col=cols)
```

```{r}
ggplot(pca$rotation) +
  aes(PC1, rownames(pca$rotation)) +
  geom_col()
```

PCA looks super useful because it gives us a great representation of our data. It facilitates visualization and gives us a dimension reduction without losing most of the information, it simplifies the data while preserving its essential structure
